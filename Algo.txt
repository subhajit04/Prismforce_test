Short Explanation of the Algorithm

Initialization:

Read Input: Get the number of test cases and for each test case, read initial power, number of skips, and recharges. Also, read the enemies’ powers for the 11 circles.
DP Table Definition:

The DP table dp[ind][currPower][skipsLeft][rechargesLeft] represents whether Abhimanyu can successfully reach the end of the Chakravyuh from the current circle (ind) with a certain amount of power (currPower), skips left (skipsLeft), and recharges left (rechargesLeft).
Base Case:

If Abhimanyu is at the end of the Chakravyuh (totalCircles), he wins as long as he has non-negative power. Initialize this state in the DP table.
DP Table Population:

Iterate from the last circle to the first circle.
For each state, check if Abhimanyu can proceed based on the available power, skips, and recharges:
Fight: If Abhimanyu has enough power to defeat the enemy.
Skip: If there are skips left, attempt to skip the current enemy.
Recharge: If there are recharges left, reset the power and attempt to move forward.
Handle regeneration of enemies’ power at specific circles (2 and 6).
Result:

Check the DP table for the starting circle with initial power, skips, and recharges to determine if Abhimanyu can cross the Chakravyuh.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(totalCircles × p × a ×b)
where:

totalCircles is the number of circles (11).
p is the maximum initial power (200).
a is the number of skips (20).
b is the number of recharges (20).

Space Complexity: O(totalCircles× p × a × b)
for storing the DP table.

This DP approach ensures that we explore all possible ways to cross the Chakravyuh efficiently by leveraging state transitions and precomputing possible outcomes for each state.
